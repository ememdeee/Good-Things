/**
 * This file contains shared functions and utilities used across different parts of the website or application.
 * The goal is to centralize common functionalities, making them easier to maintain and reuse.
 *
 * The `initializeSlider()` function is specifically designed to initialize Splide sliders. It ensures that only
 * sliders that haven't been initialized yet are set up, preventing duplicate initialization. Splide itself adds 
 * the 'is-initialized' class to each slider element that has been successfully initialized, so this function 
 * checks for that class before initializing.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Call the `initializeSlider()` function to initialize all Splide sliders that haven't been initialized yet.
 * - This function is versatile and can be used both in the front-end and within the block editor, ensuring 
 *   consistent behavior across different environments.
